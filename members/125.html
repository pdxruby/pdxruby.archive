       <b>About:</b>
       <br/>
       <p>New to Portland, Rails, and Ruby.  I am most new to Portland, having arrived mid-January 2007; least new to Ruby, having written my first Ruby script in late summer 2006.</p>
<p>I am in love with Ruby, I adore Portland, and Rails is quickly growing on me.  It took me about a day of playing to fall in love with Ruby.  I don&#8217;t know how long it took me to adore Portland, as I had a brief stay of about 4 months here 3 years ago, and it happened then.  I hated Rails upon initial inspection but have come to have an affinity for it.  That may grow into love as I come to grok it deeper over time.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be able to make the March meeting, as I&#8217;m headed up for Canada for 2 weeks, leaving on Sunday.  But I plan on coming to the April meeting.</p>
