</p>

<p>Location:

<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p><p><i>The Portland Ruby Brigade is a user group for Ruby programmers in the Portland, Oregon, area. Join other developers for presentations and discussions about Ruby and its uses.</i></p>
<p>Some of tonight&#8217;s presentations:</p>
<p>Igal Koshevoy will give an overview of a few different data stores. He will focus mostly on MongoDB and Tokyo Tyrant; but he will also touch on CouchDB. Igal will discuss the pros and cons of these databases, features, performance and how they stack up to relational databases.</p>
<p>Jesse Hallett will expand on CouchDB with an overview of some Ruby libraries that provide high-level interfaces to CouchDB and an open source <span class="caps">ORM</span> he&#8217;s building on top of it. These are the early days of non-relational databases. So in my opinion this is a good time to think hard about what a high-level interface should look like.</p>
<p>There will be a definite Ruby slant to this meeting. But there should also be a lot of information covered that will be useful to people working with any language.</p>
<p>Markus Roberts will tease and amaze us with a new Ruby mystery code sample.</p>
<p>&#8230;and more!</p>
<p><span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class="caps">VENUE</span>: This meetingâ€™s space is kindly provided by Robert Half Technology at their 2nd Floor Conference Room. Enter the <span class="caps">KOIN</span> Tower from SW Columbia between 2nd and 3rd Avenue, take the back elevators to the 2nd floor, and then follow the Ruby signs.</p></p>
