<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p><ul>
	<li><span class="caps">FOSCON</span> with input and organization from John</li>
	<li>Some other stuff.</li>
</ul></p>

  <h3>Minutes</h3>
  <p>We decide that today&#8217;s (non) agenda isn&#8217;t really<br />
conducive to podcasting.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">FOSCON</span> (led by John)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>John says that he got in touch with an O&#8217;Reilly contact<br />
and they are positive about the idea of another <span class="caps">FOSCON</span>.</li>
	<li>Eric says that he has also been in touch with O&#8217;Reilly and<br />
they have offered some space for groups like PerlMongers and<br />
<span class="caps">PDX</span>.Ruby.</li>
	<li>John proposes setting up a group of interested people to meet<br />
monthly before meetings (maybe an hour) and work on <span class="caps">FOSCON</span>. A few<br />
people suggest that they are interested in this.</li>
	<li>Difference between <span class="caps">FOSCON</span> (presumably at freegeek) and at-convention stuff? Suggestion of <span class="caps">FOSCON</span> as a party, and at-convention stuff is more formal to show people about ruby and about Portland, perhaps some hackfest type stuff. Want to avoid conflicts with other peoples parties&#8217;. Wednesday or later. Wednesday seems best becaust it is similar to last time (i.e. before many presenters present)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hackfest</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hackfest for website and other stuff. Decide on Tuesday, April 11th<br />
at Lucky Lab at 7pm. About 5 people hope to do work on the website, others will work on random projects.</li>
	<li>Eric suggests that Saturday morning hackfests may be more productive,<br />
we will look at a Saturday Morning hackfest if the Tuesday Night seems<br />
not-productive-enough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Ben wants to do ruby quizzes. People show interest, so he is going<br />
to set that up.</li>
</ul>
