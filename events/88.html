<p>1. &#8220;Ruby, Parser Generators, and External DSLs&#8221;, Luke Kanies</p>
<p>Using Puppet&#8217;s Parser as an example, we&#8217;ll talk about using Parser Generators like <span class="caps">YACC</span> and <span class="caps">ANTLR</span> to create complete external DSLs &#8211; why you would, why you wouldn&#8217;t, and what&#8217;s different about them.  We&#8217;ll even delve into some of the more complicated bits like abstract syntax trees.</p>
<p>Luke Kanies has been publishing and speaking on his work in Unix administration since 1997.  He has focused on tool development since 2001, developing and publishing multiple simple sysadmin tools and contributing to established products like Cfengine.  He founded Reductive Labs in 2005 as a response to the stagnation in sysadmin tools, to be a vehicle for changing the way we interact with and manage our computers.  He founded and is the project lead for Puppet, an open-source automation framework written in Ruby, and he is always researching and developing new ways to make it easier to talk to computers on your terms.  He has presented on Puppet and other tools around the world, including at <span class="caps">OSCON</span>, <span class="caps">LISA</span>, Linux.Conf.au, and <span class="caps">FOSS</span>.in.</p>
