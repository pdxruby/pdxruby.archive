</p>

<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2/20:</strong> You can still come to the event, even if you didn&#8217;t register/pay for the catered dinner earlier. Although you won&#8217;t get the meal, the Hilton agreed to let non-diners in for free without any additional RSVPs/registrations. The room will have extra tables and a bar if you&#8217;d like to buy drinks.]</p>
<p>Join us for an evening social event where you&#8217;ll get a chance to meet<br />
Yukihiro &#8220;Matz&#8221; Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, and members of<br />
Japanese and Oregon-based organizations that use and contribute to Ruby<br />
and open source.</p>
<p>This event will be a great way to meet Ruby and open source enthusiasts<br />
ranging from programmers to CEOs, from journalists to city officials.<br />
You&#8217;ll get a chance to learn how they&#8217;re using and promoting these tools<br />
in Oregon and Japan, and discuss the open source movement and its<br />
communities. Be ready to make some new connections, so bring your<br />
business cards. This event is <span class="caps">NOT</span> about formal lectures or sales<br />
pitches, but for facilitating interpersonal discussions and creating new<br />
relationships here and abroad.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
